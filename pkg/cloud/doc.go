/*
Package cloud implements an in memory cloud provider.

Cloud provider objects are grouped in resource groups, similarly to resource groups in Azure.

Cloud provider objects are defined like Kubernetes objects and they can be operated with
a client inspired from the controller-runtime client.

We can't use controller-runtime directly for the following reasons:
* multi-cluster (we have resourceGroups to differentiate resources belonging to different clusters)
* data should be stored in-memory
* we would like that objects in memory behave like Kubernetes objects (garbage collection)

The Manager, is the object responsible for the lifecycle of objects; it also allow
defining controllers.
